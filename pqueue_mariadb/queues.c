/*
  This code originates from the Unireg project.

  Code for generell handling of priority Queues.
  Implementation of queues from "Algorithms in C" by Robert Sedgewick.

  The queue can optionally store the position in queue in the element
  that is in the queue. This allows one to remove any element from the queue
  in O(1) time.

  Optimisation of _downheap() and queue_fix() is inspired by code done
  by Mikael RonstrÃ¶m, based on an optimisation of _downheap from
  Exercise 7.51 in "Data Structures & Algorithms in C++" by Mark Allen
  Weiss, Second Edition.

    element     Element to store at 'idx'

  NOTE
    This only works if element is >= all elements <= start_idx
